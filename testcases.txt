5: ./main 0 thread 1 , this is invald since number of threads is 0 which is out of range
valid thread/pattern
Creating: Thread
Syntax:
 ./main <optional -h> <optional -help> <int 1-256> <only valid entries 'thread' or 'process'> <requiered pattern number '1' or '2?
------Example------
./main -h
 ./main -help
 ./main -d 25 thread 1
 ./main 30 process 2
invalid num_of_things range

6: ./main -h
Syntax:
 ./main <optional -h> <optional -help> <int 1-256> <only valid entries 'thread' or 'process'> <requiered pattern number '1' or '2?
------Example------
./main -h
 ./main -help
 ./main -d 25 thread 1
 ./main 30 process 2
help cmd was triggered

7: ./main process 1 2, this is the wrong formate for executon 
Syntax:
 ./main <optional -h> <optional -help> <int 1-256> <only valid entries 'thread' or 'process'> <requiered pattern number '1' or '2?
------Example------
./main -h
 ./main -help
 ./main -d 25 thread 1
 ./main 30 process 2
invalid thread/pattern number

8: ./main -help
Syntax:
 ./main <optional -h> <optional -help> <int 1-256> <only valid entries 'thread' or 'process'> <requiered pattern number '1' or '2?
------Example------
./main -h
 ./main -help
 ./main -d 25 thread 1
 ./main 30 process 2
help cmd was triggered

9: ./main -10 process 1
this is our of the range for threads so it will display ./main -h
