# thread_and_processes
This is a program that takes user input from the command line. It creates n threads using 2 patters.
The first pattern consist of 1 root thread/process and from that the rest of the threads are created
The second pattern consists of 1 root thread/process however each thread/process is created from the 
  previous and therefore creating a linear tree

** faulty thread pattern 2 as of 12/09/2022 **
